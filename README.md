Ahlstrom Chemical Calculator Instructions
By Martina Veit Acosta

<b>1.	Introduction:</b>
As of right now, the Chemical Calculator can compute ordering amounts of Selvol and Blue Liquid for BLUPV1 and PV1 formulations. However, the same logic can be implemented for more chemicals. This would require a computer science/engineer to work along with a chemist in a bigger project. This tutorial is intended for employees with no programming background to be able to make changes to the code, for example, coat weight values and formulations amounts that can change over time. 

<b>2.	Installing VS code:</b>
I implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this website. For this reason, it is recommended to install VS Code to your computer. Type: Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined on Google and click “download” on the top right corner of your screen.

<b>3.	Opening the website as a code:</b>
Once you have VS Code installed, go to the Q drive or the location where you store the Calculator file.
Right click the file.
Select “Open with” and then VS Code.

<b>4. Understanding the code:</b>
The numbers on the left are line numbers. The text in green are comments, everything else are code lines. Please go through the comments I added so you have a better idea of the code structure. Before you make any changes, make sure you understand the math.

<b>5.	Editing the Code:</b>
To change the coat weight, formulations amount, etc. go to line 122. 
Here you can see what we call “variables”, which are like containers for information. I assigned values to our variables, for example, coat_weight is 2.5. There are also comments next to each one of them explaining its purpose. Replace the variable values as needed, but don’t forget to add a “;” by the end!
To test if your changes were effective, open the website and refresh the page. Then, type down your values and see if it is displaying them correctly.
